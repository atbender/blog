# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Hugo with the PaperMod theme. The blog is containerized using Docker and includes features like:

- Responsive design
- Dark mode support
- Search functionality
- Social media integration
- Code syntax highlighting
- And much more!

## Features

The PaperMod theme provides many great features out of the box:

1. Clean and modern design
2. Dark/Light mode toggle
3. Responsive layout
4. Social media integration
5. Search functionality
6. Code syntax highlighting
7. Table of contents
8. Reading time estimation

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Conclusion

I'm excited to start blogging with this setup. Stay tuned for more posts!
